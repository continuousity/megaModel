  title     = "Niche tradeoffs, neutrality, and community structure: a
               stochastic theory of resource competition, invasion, and
               community assembly",
  author    = "Tilman, David",
  abstract  = "Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between
               neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of
               resource competition and community structure. In stochastic
               niche theory, invading species become established only if
               propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to
               maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established
               species. The theory makes three predictions about community
               structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities
               in which species dominate approximately equally wide ``slices''
               of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths
               generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances
               for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with
               numerous observations, there are strong correlations among
               species traits, species abundances, and environmental
               conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are
               predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a
               propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause
               local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of
               resource use by established species on the establishment
               (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or
               disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment
               limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third,
               the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted
               to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low
               levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities
               created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction
               provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is
               the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily
               invaded.",

  abstract    = "How geographically widespread biological communities assemble
                 remains a major question in ecology. Do parallel population
                 histories allow sustained interactions (such as host-parasite
                 or plant-pollinator) among species, or do discordant histories
                 necessarily interrupt them? Though few empirical data exist,
                 these issues are central to our understanding of multispecies
                 evolutionary dynamics. Here we use hierarchical approximate
                 Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data for 12 herbivores and
                 19 parasitoids to reconstruct the assembly of an insect
                 community spanning the Western Palearctic and assess the
                 support for alternative host tracking and ecological sorting
                 hypotheses. We show that assembly occurred primarily by
                 delayed host tracking from a shared eastern origin. Herbivores
                 escaped their enemies for millennia before parasitoid pursuit
                 restored initial associations, with generalist parasitoids no
                 better able to track their hosts than specialists. In
                 contrast, ecological sorting played only a minor role.
                 Substantial turnover in host-parasitoid associations means
                 that coevolution must have been diffuse, probably contributing
                 to the parasitoid generalism seen in this and similar systems.
                 Reintegration of parasitoids after host escape shows these
                 communities to have been unsaturated throughout their history,

               using matrix analogues of Shannon's and Simpson's indices",
  author    = "Gorelick, Root",
  abstract  = "Shannon's and Simpson's indices have been the most widely
               accepted measures of ecological diversity for the past fifty
               years, even though neither statistic accounts for species
               abundances across geographic locales (``patches''). An abundant
               species that is endemic to a single patch can be as much of a
               conservation concern as a rare cosmopolitan species. I extend
               Shannon's and Simpson's indices to simultaneously account for
               species richness and relative abundances -- i.e. extend them to
               multispecies metacommunities -- by making the inputs to each
               index a matrix, rather than a vector. The Shannon's index
               analogue of diversity is mutual entropy of species and patches
               divided by marginal entropy of the individual geographic
               patches. The Simpson's index analogue of diversity is a
               modification of mutual entropy, with the logarithm moved to the
               outside of the summation, divided by Simpson's index of the
               patches. Both indices are normalized for number of patches, with
               the result being inversely proportional to biodiversity. These
               methods can be extended to account for time-series of such
               matrices and average age-classes of each species within each
               patch, as well as provide a measure of spatial coherence of

                 in which local populations are connected by migration and can

                 have a relatively simple structure in the limit as the number
                 of populations in the metapopulation approaches infinity. The
                 result, which is an approximation to the ancestral behaviour
                 of samples from a metapopulation with a large number of
                 populations, is the same as that previously described for

                 reflect the forces acting on biodiversity. A growing number of
                 studies have found that genetic (within-species) and species
                 diversity can be correlated in space (the so-called
                 species-gene diversity correlation [SGDC]), which suggests
                 that they are controlled by nonindependent processes. Positive
                 SGDCs are generally assumed to arise from parallel responses
                 of genetic and species diversity to variation in site size and
                 connectivity. However, this argument implicitly assumes a
                 neutral model that has yet to be developed. Here, we build

                 our model confirms that variation in the number of migrants

                 high mutation rates, interactions between mutation, migration,
                 and competition can produce negative SGDCs. Neutral processes
                 thus do not always contribute positively to SGDCs. Our

  abstract = "Abstract Neutral models in ecology have attracted much attention
              in recent literature. They can provide considerable insight into
              the roles of non-species-specific factors (e.g. stochasticity,
              dispersal, speciation) on community dynamics but often require
              intensive simulations, particularly in spatial settings. Here, we
              clearly explain existing techniques for modelling spatially
              explicit neutral processes in ecology using coalescence.
              Furthermore, we present several novel extensions to these methods
              including procedures for dealing with system boundaries which
              enable improved investigation of the effects of dispersal. We
              also present a semi-analytical algorithm that calculates the
              expected species richness in a sample, for any speciation rate.
              By eliminating the effect of stochasticity in the speciation
              process, we reduce the variance in estimates of species richness.
              Our benchmarks show that the combination of existing coalescence
              theory and our extensions produces higher quality results in
              vastly shorter time scales than previously possible: years of
              simulation time are reduced to minutes. As an example

                 address this, and develop a dynamic null model of assembly by
                 allopatric speciation, colonisation and local extinction.
                 Incorporating these processes fundamentally alters the

                 motivated a long-standing interest in the relationship between
                 the abundance distribution in a large, regional community and
                 the distribution observed in a small sample from the

                 wide range of regional-scale abundance distributions we derive
                 exact expressions for the sampled abundance distributions, as
                 a function of sample size and the degree of conspecific

                 produce the stable persistence of very large ecological
                 communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which
                 species do not interact and diversity is maintained by
                 immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small
                 fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive
                 correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary

                 persistence of large communities of interacting competitors
                 are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could
                 persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order

                 perturbation of both population abundance and parameter
                 values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong
                 effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as

                   challenge to describe how this distribution of abundances

               coupled systems of (bio)chemical reactions: continuous,
               represented by differential equations whose variables are
               concentrations or discrete, represented by stochastic processes
               whose variables are numbers of molecules. The latter approach is
               used mostly for biochemical systems with a low to moderate
               number of molecules of certain species and this kind of systems
               are typically modeled as continuous time - discrete state Markov
               Process. There are exact stochastic algorithms to simulate state
               trajectories of discrete, stochastic systems and these
               algorithms are based on methods that are rigorously equivalent
               to the Master Equation approach. Two of the most widely used
               methods for simulating the stochastic dynamics of a chemical
               system are the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA, known
               also as Gillespie algorithm) and its approximate variant, the
               tau-leaping algorithm. This paper describes a modified version
               of SSA - First reaction method - by letting the intensity rates
               of the reactions to be functions of time. The importance of this
               adaptation is obvious when considering some classes of
               biological models (for example, the one involving circadian
               rhythm). The underlying assumptions are that the system is well
               stirred such that at any moment, each reactions occur with equal
               probability at any position, that each reaction, once occurred,
               completes instantaneously (there are no reactions with delay
               involved) and that the system is non stiff (there are no
               different time scales of the reactions involved).",

  abstract  = "The scale-dependent species abundance distribution (SAD) is
               fundamental in ecology, but few spatially explicit models of
               this pattern have thus far been studied. Here we show spatially
               explicit neutral model predictions for SADs over a wide range of
               spatial scales, which appear to match empirical patterns
               qualitatively. We find that the assumption of a log-series SAD
               in the metacommunity made by spatially implicit neutral models
               can be justified with a spatially explicit model in the large
               area limit. Furthermore, our model predicts that SADs on
               multiple scales are characterized by a single, compound
               parameter that represents the ratio of the survey area to the
               species’ average biogeographic range (which is in turn set by
               the speciation rate and the dispersal distance). This intriguing
               prediction is in line with recent empirical evidence for a
               universal scaling of the species-area curve. Hence we
               hypothesize that empirical SAD patterns will show a similar
               universal scaling for many different taxa and across multiple
               spatial scales.",

                 immigrants from a metacommunity operating on a relatively slow
                 timescale, and dispersal into the local community is governed
                 by an immigration parameter m. A current problem with neutral
                 theory is that m lacks a clear biological interpretation.
                 Here, we derive analytical expressions that relate the

                 increasingly accepted as an informative null model of
                 community composition and dynamics. It has successfully
                 produced macro-ecological patterns such as species-area
                 relationships and species abundance distributions. However,
                 the models employed make many unrealistic auxiliary
                 assumptions. For example, the popular spatially implicit
                 version assumes a local plot exchanging migrants with a large
                 panmictic regional source pool. This simple structure allows
                 rigorous testing of its fit to data. In contrast, spatially
                 explicit models assume that offspring disperse only limited
                 distances from their parents, but one cannot as yet test the
                 significance of their fit to data. Here we compare the
                 spatially explicit and the spatially implicit model, fitting
                 the most-used implicit model (with two levels, local and
                 regional) to data simulated by the most-used spatially
                 explicit model (where offspring are distributed about their
                 parent on a grid according to either a radially symmetric
                 Gaussian or a 'fat-tailed' distribution). Based on these fits,
                 we express spatially implicit parameters in terms of spatially
                 explicit parameters. This suggests how we may obtain estimates
                 of spatially explicit parameters from spatially implicit ones.
                 The relationship between these parameters, however, makes no
                 intuitive sense. Furthermore, the spatially implicit model
                 usually fits observed species-abundance distributions better
                 than those calculated from the spatially explicit model's
                 simulated data. Current spatially explicit neutral models
                 therefore have limited descriptive power. However, our results
                 suggest that a fatter tail of the dispersal kernel seems to
                 improve the fit, suggesting that dispersal kernels with even
                 fatter tails should be studied in future. We conclude that
                 more advanced spatially explicit models and tools to analyze
                 them need to be developed.",

  abstract  = "The competitive exclusion principle is one of the most
               influential concepts in ecology. The classical formulation
               suggests a correlation between competitor species similarity and
               competition severity, leading to rapid competitive exclusion
               where species are very similar; yet neutral models show that
               identical species can persist in competition for long periods.
               Here, we resolve the conflict by examining two components of
               similarity -- niche overlap and competitive similarity -- and
               modeling the effects of each on exclusion rate (defined as the
               inverse of time to exclusion). Studying exclusion rate, rather
               than the traditional focus on binary outcomes (coexistence
               versus exclusion), allows us to examine classical niche and
               neutral perspectives using the same currency. High niche overlap
               speeds exclusion, but high similarity in competitive ability
               slows it. These predictions are confirmed by a well-known model
               of two species competing for two resources. Under ecologically
               plausible scenarios of correlation between these two factors,
               the strongest exclusion rates may be among moderately similar
               species, while very similar and highly dissimilar competitors
               have very low exclusion rates. Adding even small amounts of
               demographic stochasticity to the model blurs the line between
               deterministic and probabilistic coexistence still further. Thus,
               focusing on exclusion rate, instead of on the binary outcome of
               coexistence versus exclusion, allows a variety of outcomes to
               result from competitive interactions. This approach may help
               explain species coexistence in diverse competitive communities
               and raises novel issues for future work.",
