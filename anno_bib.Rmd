# Spatially explicit neutral theory

### @rosindell2008ecoInfo

An algorithm is presented to simulate spatially-explicity neutral communities in a study plot embedded within an infinite landscape.  The algorithm is backward in time (i.e. coalescent) providing computational efficiences, further added by clever indexing.  It should be noted that the coalescent algorithm they present can only provide simulated communities in equilibrium because the coalesences in allowed to occur over potentially infinite time.  This algorithm is used in @rosindell2007SAR to study the SAR.

### @odwyer2017

Spatially explicit backward time model with analytical results.  Effectively @rosindell2008ecoInfo but with an approximate analytical solution. 

### @etienne2011

Uses @rosindell2008ecoInfo to simulate spatially explicit lanscapes, but then fits classic spatially implicity neutral theory to those.  Shows that the results are not consistent, and that spatially implicit theory does a better job matching real data.  Suggests that perhaps field theory models (e.g spatailly implicit neutral theory) do better because they average over many details that explicit models must get exactly right

### @odwyer2010

Cool paper, but the field-theoretic approach is not correct, as shown by our own @grilli2012.


# Island-like theories

### @etienne2007

Provides an analytical solution to sampling formula for multiple samples from the same metacommunity.  Also provides an algorithm (seemingly backword in time) for generating such samples.  This algorithm could be a very good jumping off point for simulating multiple islands.  Immigration between islands would need to be added.  The algorithm seems to be vectorizable too.


# Environmental and non-neutral theories

### @kessler2014

Provides several models, but most usefully a forward time simulation of all the dynamics of neutral theory plus heiritable differences in fitness.  Could be useful for thinking about environmentally explicit models.  No code or pseudo code provided.

### @carmel2017

Re-dirivation of the fitness difference vs. niche difference framework, but with rigorous mathematics.  Could be a useful model for simulating species interactions but the paper itself dosen't present a simulation, only analytical results.
